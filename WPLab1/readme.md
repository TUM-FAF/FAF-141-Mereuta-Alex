# What was done:

1. We created a windows application that shows the idicated text.
2. We added a couple buttons to the app. With their help we can change the background colour, and the font of the text that we have inputed. 
Also, to be able to input this text we added a text box where we can display what ever we desire, also there is the option to delete the input.
3. We have changed the behaviour of the default window commands such as maximize, minimize and close. I have removed the ability to max/min
from those buttons although you can still do so by dragging. The close button has changed it's functionality aswell. When it is pressed,
a dialogue appears that indicates that the button that says "Exit" (which is highlighted in red) should be selected when you want to close 
the window.
